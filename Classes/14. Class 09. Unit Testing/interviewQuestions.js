1 - What is Unit Testing?
Tests to the smallest components (or units) of code, usually individual functions.

2 - What is a regression?
When you write feature #1 for a program. You then move on to feature #2. 
After finishing feature #2, you realize that your changes broke feature #1.
The introduction of such a bug is known as a regression.

3 - What is known as self-documenting code?
Code with a good, descriptive set of unit tests. 
Properly designed unit tests are runnable documentation for your project. 
Because unit tests are runnable code that declares and verifies features, 
they can NEVER get out of sync with the updated code. If feature is added 
or removed, the tests must be updated in order to make them pass.

4 - What are the types of test cases you should consider?
    - Positive Test.
    - Negative Test.
    - Edge Case.

5 - How do you run your tests?
    - You run 'node index.js'.

6 - What does TDD mean?
    TDD means Test Driven Development

7 - What is Test Driven Development?
    TDD is a software development process where the unit tests are written first.

8 - Mocking (Resources):
    Ex: Adding data to db
        Sending requests to APIs
        Interacting with extra resource
