# Interview Questions
1. What are classes? -> Blueprints for building multiple objects of 
the same type. In other words: recipes

2. What are objects? -> Instances of those classes. Food that you make with the recipe.

3. What does 'instantiate' a class mean?
To create an object using a class.

4. Naming convention for classes: Uppercase Camelcase -> Class names start with capital letters.

5. What happens if constructor is left out in a class declaration?
An empty constructor () {} is added automatically.

6. What happens when we create a new object using class without 
passing in all of the required arguments? -> the fields 
corresponding to the missing arguments will assume the value 'undefined'. 

7. Why is it recommended to assign methods in the class outside of the constructor?
Because each object created using a class would have extra code that may not 
be needed. This consumes extra memory.

8. What are the 4 principles of object-oriented programming?
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

9. What does inheritance mean?
Inheritance refers to the ability of one class to acquire properties and methods from another.

10. Remember: The classes inheriting properties and methods are child classes, and the classes 
passing down properties and methods are parent classes.

11. The extends keyword is not supported in Internet Explorer. 
--> IE doesn't support a lot of stuff. You will have to find a way around.
